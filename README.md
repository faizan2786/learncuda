# learncuda
This repo contains cuda program examples (with kernels) that I am practicing to learn Cuda for gpgpu programming mostly from the Book **"Cuda by Example"**.  

"Setup" is the **first project** created to set up and get started with Cuda using visual studio. In this project, I implemented a simple kernel to add two vectors on the gpu. I also have another function in *host.cpp* file to use larger size array and measure its performance on CPU and a GPU for a testing purpose.

I will update the code files and projects in this repo as I learn and practice further for cuda programming.

Happy Coding
